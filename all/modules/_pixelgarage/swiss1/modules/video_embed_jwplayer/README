  JWPlayer Video Embed Field Extension
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE IMPLEMENTATION IS BASED ON DELIVERY API V1.


This module provides a JWPlayer extension for the video_embed_field module. It implements a highly optimized
video streaming solution for videos hosted on the JW plattform.

The following features are available:
1)  Player selection per video embed field
    Select one of your predefined players on the JW platform for video display.

2)  Best possible video delivery.
    The implemented fallback/quality toggle scenario is: (mpd) -> m3u8 -> 406p/720p quality toggling
    (MTML5 DASH .mpd is only available for Premium accounts)
    This means, first try is to stream the video with DASH HTML5 adaptive streaming format, then with Apples HTML Live Streaming
    format (HLS) and then falls back to progressive mp4-file loading in two qualities (406p/720p) which can be toggled manually.

3)  Custom skinning of video player.
    Just put your custom skin css-file into the folder video_embed_jwplayer/css. The name of the file has to be
    <skin-name>.css. The skin is automatically recognized and made available as selectable option in the JW Player
    settings of a video embed style (admin/config/media/vef/vef_video_styles/list/jwplayer_adaptive/edit).

4)  URL signing
    The video streaming can be protected by URL signing. For this you have to set your API credentials in the settings form.

5)  Playlists (RSS/JSON) are not supported yet!

  Install the JWPLAYER MANAGEMENT API  as library
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To retrieve information about your JWPlayer account and medias, we need to install the Management API (see link below).
Follow these steps:
1) Download the PHP API Kit at http://support-static.jwplayer.com/API/php-api-kit-20151013.zip
2) Extract the zip and rename the botr-folder to "jwplayer_api"
3) Copy this folder into the libraries folder (sites/all/libraries) of your site installation.

  Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Install the video_embed_jwplayer module
2) Then configure a new style (admin/config/media/vef/vef_video_styles) for the video embed fields using
    the new available JWPlayer settings
3) Add a video embed field to a node type.
4) In the Manage Display tab set the format of the video embed field to the newly created JWPlayer style.
5) Just copy any link from a media file uploaded to the JW platform into the video link field of the video_embed_field.
   Best possible video delivery is guaranteed, no matter which file link (quality) you copy to the field. You can also
   just copy the media-id of a video attached to the jw-URL (http://content.jwplatform.com/), it works!
