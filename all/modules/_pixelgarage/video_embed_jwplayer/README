  JWPlayer Video Embed Field Extension
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE IMPLEMENTATION IS BASED ON DELIVERY API V1 AND MANAGEMENT API V1.


This module provides a JWPlayer handler for the video_embed_field module. It implements a bitrate optimized
video streaming solution for videos hosted on the JW plattform.

The following features are available:
1)  All defined Players can be selected in the video embed style.
    Select one of your predefined players on the JW platform for video display.

2)  Best possible video delivery.
    The implemented fallback/quality toggle scenario is: [DASH] -> [HLS] -> mp4 quality toggling
    (HTML5 Streaming, e.g. MPEG DASH (.mpd) or Apple's HLS (.m3u8) is only available for Premium accounts)
    This means, first try is to stream the video with DASH adaptive streaming format, then with Apples HTML Live Streaming
    format (HLS) and then falls back to progressive mp4-file with selectable video quality (180p/270p/406p/720p/1080p).

3)  Custom skinning of video player.
    Just put your custom skin css-file into the folder video_embed_jwplayer/css. The name of the file has to be
    <skin-name>.css. The skin is automatically recognized and made available as selectable option in the JW Player
    settings of a video embed style (admin/config/media/vef/vef_video_styles/list/jwplayer_adaptive/edit). For more
    information about JWPlayer skinning see the CSS skinning reference (link below).

4)  URL signing
    The video streaming can be protected by URL signing. For this you have to set your API credentials in the settings form.

5)  Playlists (RSS/JSON) are not supported yet!

  Install the JWPLAYER MANAGEMENT API SDK as library
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To retrieve information about your JWPlayer account and uploaded medias, we need to install the Management API
(see link below).

Follow these steps to install the API SDK:
1) Download the PHP API SDK at http://support-static.jwplayer.com/API/php-api-kit-20151013.zip
2) Extract the zip and rename the "botr" folder to "jwplayer_api"
3) Copy this folder into the libraries folder (sites/all/libraries) of your site installation.
4) Test the installation with the Test-Button on the JWPlayer Settings form.

  Usage and configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Install the video_embed_jwplayer module
2) Configure a new video style (admin/config/media/vef/vef_video_styles) in the Video Embed Styles form using
    the new available JWPlayer settings
3) Add a video embed field to a node type.
4) In the Manage Display tab set the format of the video embed field to the newly created JWPlayer style.
5) Just copy any link from a media file uploaded to the JW platform into the video link field.
   Best possible video delivery is guaranteed, no matter which file link (quality) you copy to the field.

   TIP: You can just copy the media-id of a video prefixed with the JW-content-base-url (http://content.jwplatform.com/),
   it works!
